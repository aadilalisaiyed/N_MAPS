Sentinel's Vault 🛡️📡
A Secure, Decentralized Communication Node for Disaster Response

Hackathon Project: IIT Gandhinagar Hackathon 2026 Track: Disaster Management / Defense Technology

📖 Overview
Sentinel's Vault is a resilient, offline communication ecosystem designed for disaster-stricken areas where traditional cellular and internet infrastructure has failed.

By leveraging a decentralized ESP32 Mesh Network, this system creates a self-healing grid that allows victims and rescue teams to exchange critical information (location, status, resource needs). Unlike standard mesh networks, Sentinel's Vault integrates hardware-level encryption to ensure that sensitive data remains secure, preventing unauthorized interception during critical operations.

🚀 Key Features
🚫 Infrastructure-Independent: Operates completely offline without Internet, GSM, or Satellite connectivity.

🕸️ Self-Healing Mesh Network: Nodes (ESP32) automatically reroute data if a path fails, ensuring high availability in chaotic environments.

🔒 Hardware-Level Security: Implements robust encryption directly on the hardware to secure messages against spoofing and interception.

📍 Real-Time Telemetry: Transmits GPS coordinates and status updates from "victim nodes" to "rescue command centers."

🔋 Low Power Consumption: Optimized for long-term deployment on battery/solar power in remote locations.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Hardware
Microcontroller: ESP32 (WROOM/WROVER modules)

Communication Protocol: ESP-NOW / WiFi Mesh

Sensors: GPS Modules (NEO-6M), Environment Sensors (optional)

Power: Li-Ion Battery Packs

Software & Firmware
Language: C++ / Embedded C

Framework: ESP-IDF / Arduino

Encryption Standard: AES-128/256 (Hardware Accelerated) / ASCON (Lightweight)

Dashboard: Python (using Flask/Streamlit for the Command Center visualization)

⚙️ Architecture
Node A (Victim/Field Unit): Broadcasts encrypted distress signal containing UUID and GPS data.

The Mesh: Intermediate nodes relay the packet via the most efficient path using the mesh routing algorithm.

Node B (Command Center/Gateway): Receives the encrypted packet, decrypts it using the hardware key, and logs the data to the central dashboard.
